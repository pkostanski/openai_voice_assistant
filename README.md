# openai_voice_assistant
a simple voice assistant application that uses OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo for generating responses and Google Speech Recognition for converting speech to text. The application listens to the user's voice input, transcribes it to text, and sends the text to GPT-3.5 Turbo. The AI model then generates a response, which is printed in the console.
